Project Description :

CRED is a members only credit card bill payment platform that rewards its members for clearing their credit card bills on time.It means you get to use your card now and pay for your purchases later.CRED members get access to exclusive rewards and intensives from premier brands upon clearing their credit card bills on CRED.It also offers you a record of expenses,EMI facility,fraud protection and also budgeting tools and calculators to help users manage their personal finances,expense tracking,loan calculator and debt repayment planning.

Problem Targeted :

1) Most people these days have multiple credit cards,it can get extremely overwhelming to keep a tab on multiple payment deadlines.
 
2) Hidden charges on credit cards are not clearly disclosed in the credit card app which showcases the quality of intransparency.

3) Many people get occupied with their work wherein they forget their due payment where they have to bear high interest rate.

Solution Proposed :

1) To reduce the headache of keeping a track on multiple payment deadlines,Cred has its "All in one place" platform which reduces the need to switch from various platform and stick to one by managing all credit cards at one place.

Credit cards are widely accepted, making them convenient for various types of transactions, including online purchases and reservations. Carrying large sums of cash isn't practical or safe.

2) Transparent disclosure of all hidden charges allows consumers to make informed decisions about their financial choices. They can weigh the costs and benefits, select the best options, and plan their finances accordingly.When users are confident that all charges are openly communicated, they are more likely to trust and maintain a positive relationship.

3) Autopay is scheduled to deduct the payment on the due date of the credit card statement.This ensures that the payment is made on time, avoiding late payment fees and potential credit score damage.Autopay eliminates the need to manually make payments each month, saving time and effort.

Many credit cards provide cashback where  payment is done on due date.Cardholders can earn a percentage of their spending back in return.
